I'm a self-taught developer with 1 year and a half of hands-on experience in **web development**, and currently a second year **DAW** student.

- Building a URL Shortener using Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, REST API, React, TailwindCSS, and Docker.
- Practicing backend logic, API design, and clean architecture.
- Enhancing deployment skills with Docker and service separation.
- Diving deeper into Full-Stack Development, with a main focus on Back-End.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm learning:
- Exploring design patterns in **Java** and **SpringBoot**.
